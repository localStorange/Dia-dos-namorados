My love, you are one of the main reasons for my evolution, whether as a man or as a student. 
You showed me that there is no point in changing for others, but rather, I have to be okay 
with myself and change for myself, and I am grateful for that. You are my other half, my soulmate, 
my princess, my love, the woman I chose to be my future wife and who will be the mother of my children. 
I will never tire of thanking God for having placed you in my life. You have taught me countless things, 
and one of them was to rest on vacation. You are an example of a woman and I am very proud of you, of 
your daily effort, of always making yourself available to help those in need, of often thinking twice 
before responding to any nonsense I send when you are stressed. I realize how afraid you are of hurting 
me, but it is like I said when we were getting to know each other: I accept both your perfections and your 
imperfections, and I will always be by your side, in good times and in bad.
